# Product Features

- CoinCrowd Subscription: This feature enables crypto influencers to make their trading portfolios public for paid subscribers. Subscribers can view real-time trades made by crypto influencers.
- CoinCrowd Alert: This product is an AI-based tracker that scrapes different news platforms and predicts price alerts from historic trends and data. The tracker is a parameterised ML Model that generates a confidence score based on the parameters used for generating a prediction for transparency and regulatory purposes. Example parameters sample sentiment from persons of interest, government regulation (negative or positive), and dumping trends.
